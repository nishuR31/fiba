A collection of different ways to generate Fibonacci numbers in Python — from beginner to pro, recursive to iterative, and even memoized.

## 📁 Files Included

| File      | Description                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `fibo1.py` | 🔁 Iterative method using `x, y = y, x+y` |
| `fibo2.py` | 🔃 Recursive method (no memo)              |
| `fibo3.py` | 🧠 Recursive with manual memoization       |
| `fibo4.py` | 🧰 Recursive with `@lru_cache` decorator    |

## 🧮 What is Fibonacci?

Fibonacci sequence is:  
`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...`  
Where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
